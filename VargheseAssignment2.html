        <em><b>Disclaimer: I do not own RWBY or Tokyo Ghoul</b></em>    
        
            <p> <em>‘Well here’s the next payload’ </em>Torchwick and his borrowed henchmen walked down the streets of Vale, their march heading towards a dust vendor. Despite their regal clothing, Torchwick’s crew hands were far from clean, as bloodshed and corruption covered them. As they walked to their destination, many of the onlookers each hustled together, fear emanating from them, as a vicious gang walked to the dust shop. Inside the dust shop, called from Dust till Dawn, an old man stayed at the counter, grimacing as Torchwick walked in the store, the ringing bell signifying not only a customer but an unfortunate end. 

            <p>“Alright grandpa, you know what we are after,” Torchwick took up his cane and aimed the bottom tip of it at the store owner, revealing a hole loaded up with fire dust, ready to blow its target’s head off. “Come on boys! We don’t got long before Vale’s hunters get here!” </p>
            
            <p>The crew dispersed and began to open their large duffle bags and started to steal all of the dust they could get their hands on. Amid the robbery, one of the henchmen noticed a small figure at the side of the story, wearing a red cloak and combat boots, seem to be reading a book. The henchman took out his sword and yelled at the figure.</p>
            <p>“Hey kid! Put your hands up in the air!” The henchman approached the child, crossing through the store’s aisles to reach the person. As he got closer, the small figure was just a little girl coming into the wrong place at the wrong time. He tapped her shoulder in one hand, the sword in the other in case there was any resistance. The girl spun around,  her dark hair and red highlights creating deep contrast with her pale white skin, her face of innocence, with grey eyes that were constantly swirling with curiosity. The henchman then motioned to her headphones, which were causing the interruption of communication. Once she took them off, the henchman repeated his words. 
            “Alright, put your hands where I can see them!” The henchman threateningly showed his sword, hoping that the intimidation would do the trick, unlucky for him, the girl in front of him was not so ordinary. Rather she tipped her head and asked, “Are you robbing me?” </p>
            
            <p> The henchman exasperated by the oblivious tone in the girl's question replied, “Yes!” </p>
            <p>Seconds later, that same henchman was blown across the shop, alerting the other henchmen about the “threat”. Torchwick, waiting for the old man to finish putting the dust in the bag, signaled for the other henchmen to take action… Only another one of them to be blown through the store’s windows, a red and black buzz on top of him. Now that she was fully exposed, the girl took out a large red gun from her back, letting it unfurl to a merciless curved blade, a massive scythe twice the size of herself. The other henchmen ran to the window looking a bit timid, as they were not expected a huntress to be in the vicinity. </p>
            
            <p>Torchwick also began to recognize the “threat” that was going to ruin their business run. </p>
            
            <p>“Ok, get her!” Rather than his usual carefree self, he ordered the last of the men to gang up against the girl. The girl twirled her scythe and used the twirling to build up momentum for her first kick, aimed at the first man, who was wielding a red katar. He was instantly knocked out by the attack and while the others tried to attack back, the girl shifted her scythe so that the head pointed towards the ground, and activated its second ability. A loud gunshot was heard, and the girl was up in the air, swinging against the second man who pulled his sword up to parry the attack but got knocked aside like the first one. The last of the men saw both of his allies get knocked down by a single blow by a little girl, he was on edge, taking a safe approach and shooting his dust pistol at the girl, however, using her scythe’s gun, she dodged each bullet while gaining ground against the criminal before swinging and hitting him with the back of her scythe, leaving Torchwick by himself. </p>
