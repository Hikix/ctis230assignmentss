            <p> "Kaneki!" Hide scrambled away from a massive claw, leaving a crater where Hide was seconds ago. "Do something! I don't want to lose all of my loot!"

                <br>Kaneki sighed, he already told Hide that the boss of level 28, Waheela the Black Wolf, would be too much for them. Most people fight a boss in parties of 4 or 5. But Hide was too eager with his new sword, Bloodbane, which he'd got from a rare mob of floor 27.
                
                <br>Kaneki took his wand and started a spell, "Illusion spell: Shadow Clones!"
                
                <br>As a Spriggan, Kaneki was only good with his illusion magic, which may seem pretty useless, but he liked it for its versatility. He has gotten too many good laughs from scaring the hell out of Hide whenever they were fighting mobs or just messing around in general. Also, it was very effective against mobs and bosses.
                
                <br>And that held true against this boss too. The wolf looked at the clones of him and slashed to bits.
                
                <br>"Hide! Let's attack now!" Kaneki took out his katana and used a sword skill, Dash. His katana lit up in a bright red color, and Kaneki let it take control of his body. His body rushed forward and sliced the wolf's belly.
                
                <br>"Kaneki, behind you!" As the wolf's three whip-like tails threw him against the moss-covered wall of the boss room. 'Whelp, we're screwed.' Kaneki thought. His HP bar dropped to the red zone, one more hit and he was a goner. The wolf locked eyes on his virtual body, knowing that he was weak. It pounced and was about to finish him off, but luckily Hide was there to save the day.
                
                <br>"Come on! Don't give up yet! I don't want to lose our loot." Hide whined, dragging Kaneki by the straps of his armor.
                
                <br>Kaneki shrugged Hide off, looking for a healing potion, their last one. "Well, we are gonna die either way and might as well use all of our stuff." Kaneki drank it, filling up his health bar back to green.
                
                <br>"Haha! Thats the spirit Kaneki!" Hide took out Bloodbane. "OK, I think I might have a plan, just give me 30 seconds!"
                
                <br>Kaneki rolled his eyes. There was no way he could delay the boss for 30 seconds, and he used one of most useful spells, Shadow Clones , already and most bosses were pretty smart so that was a no go. He looked at the ferocious beast in front, which thought of another illusion spell. A transformation! While Waheela may be able to see through his disguise, he could use that to his advantage. The disguise will give him the same reach and height of the monster he chooses to disguise to, but which monster to choose from.
                
                <br>Kaneki broke out of his thoughts as the boss howled. Kaneki ran as the wolf pounced. 'Crap this isn't the time to be deciding, I only need to give Hide 30 seconds!' Kaneki yelled and pulled out his katana to try to counterattack, but was hopelessly dismissed by the crazy reaction speed and power of the boss's tails. However, Kaneki, after experiencing once dodged and counterattacked again slicing one of the tails off the boss. The wolf howled in pain, summoning 5 smaller wolf-like monsters called Fanged Minions. Kaneki prepared a move, Raging Wind Slashes, as the Fanged Minions started their rush.
                
                <br>His combo move was able to cut through two of the beasts before the last three overwhelmed the third strike. He rolled away, but not in time to avoid one of the minions claws. Kaneki winced as his health bar was dropped by 25%.
                
                <br>"Hide, are you done yet! I'm getting killed over here." Kaneki ran around the room to get some distance from the wolves, but they were smarter than he thought, after running for a few seconds, he realized that he was cornered, a wolf on each side. 'Crap, I'm so screwed' he thought.
                
                <br>Suddenly a ray of hope shined, "Kaneki! Run to the wall, my move is ready!"
                
                <br>'Bout time.' Kaneki did what Hide instructed. He looked to Hide and saw that his sword was glowing a light crimson. 'What's he doing? A special skill, perhaps?' Kaneki gritted his virtual teeth as he avoided the minions and started running to the wall.
                
                <br>Then there was a large howl as all of the three minions vanished into shards. Kaneki turned back and saw Hide grinning.
                
                <br>"Hehehe, thanks to Bloodbane I got a pretty sick move, Blood Rage which gives me a significant speed and better yet it's a combo move that gets stronger per strike!" A smug Hide said. Kaneki sighed, "And with all of that talking you're gonna waste that combo."
                
                <br>He readied his katana and stood next to Hide. "So let's get to killing that boss!"
                
                <br>Hide yelled, "Hell ya!" and rushed in with surprising agility, since Bloodbane was still a hefty one handed sword. Kaneki prepared an illusion spell and decided on turning into a wolf himself, he was thinking that the illusion will make the boss hesitant against his own minions. Which proved true. The boss was distracted which let Hide cut off the remaining tails of the boss. The boss howled, its hp bar going down into its final health bar. Kaneki used Slice and Dice, which allowed him to cut the wolf's right legs, making it collapse to its side. "Come on Hide let's do this!" Hide was becoming a sword frenzy, slicing every bit of the wolf as he could to keep the combo moving. Kaneki didn't want to let Hide have all of the fun and joined in with his own combo move Lightning Annihilation. He started to slice the boss, in a zigzag form.
                
                <br>Suddenly, as the boss's health bar reached the redzone. It released a tremendous force, which shoved both Kaneki and Hide a few meters. It then opened its mass and started to draw energy towards it. "Umm, how are we gonna avoid that!" Kaneki was pretty spooked, he didn't realize that the boss would have freaking lasers at its end stage.
                
                <br>"Just run!" Hide tugged Kaneki and they both started to run clockwise around the room, "We gotta regroup, we can try to counterattack afterwards!" Kaneki sighed, " Where are we gonna run, it a laser it's not like you can out run it!"
                
                <br>Hide grimaced as he knew that Kaneki was right. "Or how about I can sacrifice myse-"
                
                <br>"No" Kaneki interjected, "Cause if you do then you're gonna whine about losing Bloodbane and we are not gonna grind for that again, no way." Kaneki thought, 'There has to be a way, maybe it could panic if I use a clone decoy, but my mana is getting pretty lowâ€¦ Eh what the hell! Its not like I can do anything else anyway.
                
                <br>"Hide on my count of 3, run directly at the boss!" Kaneki started muttering the words of his spell.
                
                <br>"What the hell are you crazy, if I get hit by that lazer I'm gonna turn to a human crisp," Hide scowled, noticing that Kaneki was ignoring him, "Fine, but if I die you gonna owe a week worth of Big Girl's Burgers!"
                
                <br>"Yeah sure," Kaneki spell was finished, "Alright, 1, 2, 3!" Hide sprinted right at the wolf which started to direct its laser at him but missed him completely. Hide was confused until he saw all of the other clones of him next to him. 'Damn Kaneki, I might have to owe you a burger when we finish' Hide thought as he sprinted right towards the wolf using Vorpal Strike to deal the ending blow. The wolf howled, creating shockwaves around the room before exploding into shards.
                
                <br>"Haha! Let's go Kaneki! Whatda I say, I knew we could handle that boss easy!"
                
                <br>Kaneki walked towards him and smacked Hide's head. "Dude you totally owe me a Big Girls Burger, but I cant admit that we did pretty nice."
                
                <br>Hide put an arm around Kaneki's shoulder, "Exactly, thats what I'm talking about!" As he started to laugh and quickly spread to Kaneki as well.
                
                <br>And the duo cheerfully walked up to the net floor.
